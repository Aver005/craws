  scripts/render-release-notes.sh's argument list.

## 🦀 CRAWS DEV-build `{{TAG}}`

> {{COMMIT_TITLE}}

Rolling preview built from `{{BRANCH}}` — always the latest commit that passed CI.
**This is not a stable release.** Each archive holds both CLI binaries
(`craws`, the headless pipeline runner, and `craws-mcp`, the MCP server);
desktop installers bundle the Tauri shell.

`{{VERSION}}`  ·  [`{{COMMIT_SHORT_SHA}}`]({{REPO_URL}}/commit/{{COMMIT_SHA}})  ·  built {{BUILD_DATE}}  ·  `{{RUST_VERSION}}`  ·  [CI run #{{RUN_ID}}]({{RUN_URL}})

### 📦 Downloads

{{ARTIFACT_LIST}}

<sub>CLI archives (`.tar.gz` / `.zip`) → drop `craws` + `craws-mcp` on your `PATH`. Installers (`.exe` / `.dmg` / `.deb` / `.AppImage`) → the desktop app.</sub>
